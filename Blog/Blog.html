                <h3>Cooking Tips for Beginners</h3>
                    <h5>
                        1. Start with simple recipes: Begin with recipes that have fewer ingredients and simpler cooking techniques. This will help you build confidence in the kitchen.
                    </h5>
                    <h5>
                        2. Read the recipe thoroughly: Before you start cooking, make sure you read the recipe from start to finish. This will help you understand the steps involved and gather all the necessary ingredients and equipment.
                    </h5>
                    <h5>                        
                        3. Prep ingredients beforehand: Chop, measure, and organize all your ingredients before you start cooking. This will make the cooking process smoother and more efficient.
                    </h5>
                    <h5>
                        4. Invest in basic kitchen tools: Equip your kitchen with essential tools like a chef's knife, cutting board, pots, pans, spatula, and wooden spoons. You don't need fancy gadgets to cook delicious meals.
                    </h5>
                    <h5>
                    5. Learn basic cooking techniques: Mastering basic cooking techniques like chopping, saut√©ing, boiling, and baking will lay the foundation for more complex dishes in the future.
                    </h5>
                    <h5>
                        6. Season your food: Don't be afraid to season your food with salt, pepper, herbs, and spices. Taste as you go and adjust the seasoning accordingly.
                        
                    </h5>
                    <h5>

                        7. Don't overcrowd the pan: When cooking on the stovetop, make sure not to overcrowd the pan. This will prevent your food from steaming instead of browning.
                    </h5>
                    <h5>
                        8. Practice patience: Cooking takes time, so be patient and don't rush the process. Allow your food to cook properly and develop flavors.

                    </h5>
                    <h5>

                        9. Don't be afraid to make mistakes: Everyone makes mistakes in the kitchen, especially when they're starting out. Learn from your mistakes and use them as opportunities to improve your cooking skills.
                    </h5>
                    <h5>

                        10. Experiment and have fun: Cooking is a creative process, so don't be afraid to experiment with different ingredients and flavors. Have fun in the kitchen and enjoy the process of creating delicious meals.
                    </h5>
